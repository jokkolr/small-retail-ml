# Smart Retail ML

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution for retail businesses.  
It focuses on:
- Predicting product demand (time-series forecasting)
- Segmenting customers (clustering)
- Analyzing customer reviews for sentiment (NLP)

## Project Goals
- Help businesses forecast sales accurately
- Identify high-value customer segments
- Provide insights from customer feedback

## Folder Structure
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `scripts/` – Python scripts for ML models and preprocessing
- `models/` – Saved trained models
- `api/` – FastAPI or Flask API for serving models
- `dashboard/` – Streamlit or React dashboard

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels, Prophet)
- NLP: NLTK, Transformers
- Time-series models: ARIMA, LSTM
- Deployment: FastAPI / Flask, optionally AWS or Databricks

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
